- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Risk Mitigated:** No tokens in process memory

### ‚úÖ **Action 5: Authentication Verification**
- **Time:** 11:24 UTC
- **Action:** Verified NPM authentication state
- **Command:** `npm whoami`
- **Result:** ‚ùå Authentication required (good - token cleared)
- **Status:** COMPLETED

### ‚úÖ **Action 6: Package Verification**
- **Time:** 11:24 UTC
- **Action:** Verified package integrity on NPM
- **Package:** @clduab11/gemini-flow@1.0.0
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Package intact and accessible
- **Downloads:** Monitoring for unusual activity

### ‚úÖ **Action 7: Git Repository Cleanup**
- **Time:** 11:25 UTC
- **Action:** Removed sensitive files from git tracking
- **Files:** npm-auth.js, .npmrc
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Verification:** ‚úÖ Clean git status
