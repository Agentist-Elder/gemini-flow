# V1.3.0 Root Cleanup Archive Inventory

## Overview
This directory contains files moved from the project root during the v1.3.0 release cleanup process. These files were relocated to maintain a clean, professional project structure.

## Archived Files

### Reports and Implementation Plans
- `NPM_PUBLICATION_REPORT.md` - Report on NPM package publication process
- `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Project migration planning documentation  
- `DUAL-MODE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` - Implementation plan for dual-mode architecture

### Release Documentation
- `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.3.0.md` - Moved to `docs/releases/` directory

### Temporary Files Removed
- `README.md.backup` - Backup file (deleted)
- `gemini-flow-1.3.0.tgz` - Package tarball (deleted)
- `coordination/` - Temporary coordination directory (deleted)
- `test-readme-commands.sh` - Temporary test script (deleted)

### Configuration Files Relocated
- `copilot-instructions.md` - Moved to `docs/guides/`

## Cleanup Rationale

### Professional Structure
- Maintain clean project root with only essential files
- Separate documentation by type and purpose
- Archive implementation artifacts for reference

### Essential Root Files (Retained)
- `README.md` - Primary project documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code configuration
- `GEMINI.md` - Gemini integration guide
- `LICENSE` - Project license
- `package.json` - Package configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

### .gitignore Enhancements
Added comprehensive rules to prevent future root clutter:
- Backup files (`*.backup`, `*-backup.*`)
- Implementation plans (`*_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`)
- Temporary coordination directories
- Test scripts and temporary files

## Post-Cleanup Structure Benefits

1. **Professional Appearance**: Clean root directory with only essential files
2. **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns and file types
3. **Documented**: Proper archival with inventory tracking
