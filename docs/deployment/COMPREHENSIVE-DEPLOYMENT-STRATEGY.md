**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch → Production deployment
- Push to `develop` branch → Staging deployment  
- Pull requests → Development validation
- Manual dispatch → Any environment

**Pipeline Stages:**

```yaml
stages:
  1. Environment Detection:

     - Configure feature flags
     
  2. Security Scanning:
     - Trivy vulnerability scanning
     - Dependency audit
     - License compliance check
     
  3. Build & Test Matrix:
     - Multi-OS testing (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
     - Multi-Node.js versions (18, 20, 22)
     - Unit, integration, and E2E tests
     
  4. Docker Build:
     - Multi-architecture builds (amd64, arm64)
     - Security scanning
     - Registry push
     
  5. Infrastructure Provisioning:
     - Terraform plan and apply

  8. Rollback (if needed):
     - Automatic failure detection
     - One-click rollback capability
```

#### 2. **Supporting Workflows**

- **Security Scanning** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)
- **Performance Testing** (`.github/workflows/performance.yml`)
- **Documentation Updates** (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`)
- **Dependency Updates** (`.github/workflows/dependabot.yml`)

### Deployment Strategies by Environment

| Environment | Strategy | Automation Level | Approval Required |
|-------------|----------|------------------|-------------------|

## 🔵🟢 Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

### Overview

Blue-Green deployment provides zero-downtime deployments by maintaining two identical production environments.

### Configuration

#### Environment Setup
```yaml
# Blue Environment (Current Production)
blue:
  replicas: 5
  traffic_weight: 100%
  status: active
  
# Green Environment (New Version)
green:
  replicas: 5
  traffic_weight: 0%
  status: standby
```

#### Deployment Process

1. **Preparation Phase**
   - Deploy new version to Green environment
   - Run health checks and validation
   - Perform smoke tests

2. **Traffic Switch**
   - Gradual traffic migration: 0% → 100%
   - Monitor metrics and error rates
   - Validate user experience

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Run full integration tests
   - Monitor for 15 minutes
   - Collect performance metrics

4. **Finalization**
   - Make Green environment the new Blue
   - Scale down old Blue environment
   - Update DNS records if needed

### Automated Rollback

```yaml
rollback_triggers:
  - error_rate > 5%
  - response_time > 2000ms
  - health_check_failures > 3
  - custom_metric_threshold_breach
```

### Argo Rollouts Configuration

Located at `/infrastructure/argo-rollouts/blue-green-rollout.yaml`, this configuration provides:

- **Automated traffic switching**
- **Health check validation**
- **Performance analysis**
- **One-click rollback capability**

---

## 🕯️ Canary Release Automation

### Canary Strategy

Canary deployments gradually roll out changes to a subset of users, minimizing risk.

### Traffic Progression

```yaml
canary_steps:
  - traffic: 5%
    duration: 2m
    analysis: basic_health
    
  - traffic: 10%
    duration: 5m
    analysis: [success_rate, error_rate]
    
  - traffic: 20%
    duration: 5m
    analysis: [success_rate, error_rate]
    
  - traffic: 40%
    duration: 10m
    analysis: [success_rate, error_rate, cpu_usage, memory_usage]
    
  - traffic: 60%
    duration: 10m
    analysis: extended_validation
    
  - traffic: 80%
    duration: 5m
    analysis: final_validation
    
  - traffic: 100%
    analysis: deployment_complete
```

### Analysis Templates

#### Success Rate Analysis
```yaml
success_rate:
  threshold: ">= 99.5%"
  measurement_window: "5m"
  failure_limit: 3
  evaluation_interval: "1m"
```

#### Error Rate Analysis
```yaml
error_rate:
  threshold: "<= 0.5%"
  measurement_window: "5m"
  failure_limit: 3
  evaluation_interval: "1m"
```

#### Response Time Analysis
```yaml
response_time:
  threshold: "<= 500ms"
  percentile: 95
  measurement_window: "5m"
  failure_limit: 3
```

### Automatic Rollback Conditions

- **Error rate spike:** > 1% increase from baseline
- **Response time degradation:** > 50% increase from baseline
- **Health check failures:** > 3 consecutive failures
- **Custom business metrics:** Revenue drop, conversion rate decrease
