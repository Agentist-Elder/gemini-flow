# Legacy Artifacts Archive

This directory contains archived legacy coordination artifacts that were migrated from the original claude-flow configuration to the new gemini-flow structure.

## Archived Components

### Hive Mind System (.hive-mind/)
- Original distributed coordination system
- Session management and memory databases
- Agent coordination protocols

### Swarm Coordination (.swarm/)
- Legacy swarm memory databases
- Coordination state files
- Agent synchronization data

### Room Modes (.roomodes)
- Legacy room-based coordination
- Modal interaction patterns

### Claude Configuration (.claude/)
- Original Claude-specific configuration
- Agent definitions and command structures
- Hook systems and automation scripts

## Migration Summary

**Date**: January 2025
**Purpose**: Clean architecture transition from claude-flow to gemini-flow
**Status**: Complete

### What Was Migrated

1. **Configuration Structure**: `.claude/` → `.gemini/`
2. **Documentation**: `CLAUDE.md` → `GEMINI.md`
3. **Agent Definitions**: Preserved core agents, updated for Gemini
4. **Command Structure**: Updated CLI commands for gemini-flow
5. **Memory Systems**: Simplified and optimized

### What Was Preserved

- Core SPARC methodology
- Batchtools optimization patterns
- Agent coordination principles
- Performance benchmarking capabilities
- Essential development workflows

### What Was Removed

- Legacy coordination artifacts
- Obsolete session files
- Redundant memory databases
- Deprecated command structures
- Unused configuration files

## Restoration

If you need to restore any legacy functionality:

1. Review the archived files in their respective subdirectories
2. Extract relevant configuration patterns
3. Adapt to current gemini-flow structure
4. Test compatibility with current system

## Notes

- These files are kept for historical reference only
- Do not restore directly without careful review
- Consider security implications of any restored components
- Update paths and references to match current structure
