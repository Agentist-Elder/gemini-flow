## SRE Principles

### Four Golden Signals
1. **Latency** - Response time for successful and failed requests
2. **Traffic** - Request rate and user activity patterns  
3. **Errors** - Rate of failed requests and error types
4. **Saturation** - Resource utilization and capacity constraints

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime (8.77 hours downtime/year)
- **Latency**: 
  - Text Generation: < 100ms p95
  - Multimodal Streaming: < 500ms p95
  - AgentSpace Operations: < 200ms p95
- **Throughput**: Handle 10,000 concurrent requests
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% error rate

## Quick Reference

### Emergency Contacts
- **On-Call Engineer**: Use PagerDuty rotation
- **Escalation Manager**: TBD
- **Security Team**: security@company.com
- **Google Cloud Support**: Case routing via console

### Critical Procedures
- [Service Startup/Shutdown](#service-operations)
- [Incident Response](#incident-response)
- [Emergency Rollback](#rollback-procedures)
- [Performance Degradation](#troubleshooting)

## Getting Started

1. **New Team Members**: Start with [Team Documentation](team-documentation/)
2. **Operations Engineers**: Review [Service Operations](service-operations/)
3. **Incident Response**: Familiarize with [Incident Playbooks](incident-response/)
4. **Development Teams**: Check [Maintenance Procedures](maintenance/)

## Contributing

When updating runbooks:
1. Follow the [Runbook Standards](team-documentation/runbook-standards.md)
2. Test all procedures in staging environment
3. Update automation scripts accordingly
4. Review with SRE team before merging
