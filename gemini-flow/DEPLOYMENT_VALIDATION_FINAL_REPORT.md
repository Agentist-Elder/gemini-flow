   - Address 90+ TypeScript errors
   - Restore strict type checking
   - Fix import/export issues

2. **Restore Test Suite**
   - Fix Jest configuration
   - Address timeout issues
   - Ensure all tests pass

3. **CLI Command Restoration**
   - Restore full command functionality
   - Exit emergency mode
   - Enable all advanced features
