/**
 * WebRTC Architecture Unit Tests
 * Framework: auto-detected (Vitest or Jest). Uses BDD-style describe/it and explicit WebRTC globals mocking.
 *
 * Focus: Validate signaling flows, SDP handling, ICE candidate plumbing, and error paths.
 * These tests emphasize recent PR changes (diff) to ensure behavior around offer/answer creation,
 * ICE candidate queuing before setRemoteDescription, and teardown/cleanup robustness.
