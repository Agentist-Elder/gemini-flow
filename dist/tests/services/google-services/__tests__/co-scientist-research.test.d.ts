/**
 * RED-GREEN-REFACTOR CYCLE DOCUMENTATION FOR COSCIENTIST RESEARCH:
 *
 * This comprehensive test suite demonstrates London School TDD applied to
 * scientific research automation and validation:
 *
 * 1. PROPERTY-BASED TESTING INTEGRATION:
 *    - Tests validate behavior across diverse input spaces
 *    - Hypothesis generation tested with various domains and observations
 *    - Statistical analysis validated across different methods and parameters
 *    - ML configurations tested with multiple algorithms and validation approaches
 *
 * 2. SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGY VALIDATION:
 *    - All aspects of research pipeline tested: hypothesis → experiment → analysis → validation
 *    - Statistical validity, causal inference, and reproducibility requirements
 *    - AI integration for research enhancement and optimization
 *
 * 3. COMPLEX RESEARCH WORKFLOW COORDINATION:
 *    - Multi-phase research execution with proper error handling
 *    - Integration of traditional statistics with modern ML approaches
 *    - Knowledge base integration for domain-specific research guidance
 *
 * 4. LONDON SCHOOL PRINCIPLES IN SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT:
 *    - RED: Define expected scientific workflow behavior through failing tests
 *    - GREEN: Implement research coordination logic to satisfy scientific contracts
 *    - REFACTOR: Improve research workflow patterns while maintaining scientific rigor
 *
 * Key Scientific Collaboration Patterns Tested:
 * - AIEngine ↔ KnowledgeBase (hypothesis generation with domain knowledge)
 * - ExperimentEngine ↔ SafetySystem (automated experimentation with safety protocols)
 * - AnalysisEngine ↔ ValidationEngine (statistical analysis with reproducibility checks)
 * - MLEngine ↔ InterpretabilityTools (model training with explainable results)
 * - CausalInference ↔ DomainKnowledge (causal reasoning with scientific constraints)
 *
 * This design promotes rigorous scientific methodology while leveraging AI
 * for research acceleration and enhanced reproducibility.
