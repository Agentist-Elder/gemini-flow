/**
 * RED-GREEN-REFACTOR CYCLE DOCUMENTATION FOR MARINER AUTOMATION:
 *
 * This test suite demonstrates comprehensive London School TDD for complex automation:
 *
 * 1. ORCHESTRATION TESTING:
 *    - Tests focus on HOW MarinerAutomation coordinates between subsystems
 *    - Browser session management, task queue coordination, AI integration
 *    - Resource management and performance monitoring coordination
 *
 * 2. BEHAVIOR-DRIVEN MOCKING:
 *    - All dependencies are mocked to isolate MarinerAutomation behavior
 *    - Mocks verify interaction patterns, not implementation details
 *    - Error injection tests verify recovery and cleanup coordination
 *
 * 3. COMPLEX WORKFLOW TESTING:
 *    - Multi-step task execution with condition validation
 *    - Browser pool management with resource constraints
 *    - AI-enhanced automation with fallback strategies
 *
 * 4. LONDON SCHOOL PRINCIPLES:
 *    - RED: Define expected coordination behavior through failing tests
 *    - GREEN: Implement minimal orchestration logic to pass tests
 *    - REFACTOR: Improve coordination patterns while maintaining contracts
 *
 * Key Collaboration Patterns Tested:
 * - TaskQueue ↔ TaskScheduler (task prioritization and execution)
 * - BrowserSession ↔ ResourceManager (resource allocation and limits)
 * - AIEngine ↔ TaskOptimizer (intelligent automation enhancement)
 * - PerformanceMonitor ↔ BrowserMonitoring (metrics collection and analysis)
 * - PluginManager ↔ TaskExecution (extensible automation capabilities)
