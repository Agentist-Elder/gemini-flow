/**
 * RED-GREEN-REFACTOR CYCLE DOCUMENTATION:
 *
 * Each test in this suite follows the London School TDD approach:
 *
 * 1. RED Phase:
 *    - Write a failing test that describes the expected interaction
 *    - Focus on HOW objects should collaborate, not WHAT they contain
 *    - Use mocks to define contracts between collaborators
 *
 * 2. GREEN Phase:
 *    - Write minimal implementation to make the test pass
 *    - Focus on making the interactions work correctly
 *    - Don't worry about optimization yet
 *
 * 3. REFACTOR Phase:
 *    - Improve the code structure while keeping tests green
 *    - Extract methods, improve naming, optimize performance
 *    - Tests should continue to pass without modification
 *
 * Key London School Principles Applied:
 * - Mock ALL external dependencies
 * - Test interactions, not state
 * - Use mocks to drive design decisions
 * - Focus on object collaboration patterns
 * - Verify behavior through mock assertions
