/**
 * RED-GREEN-REFACTOR CYCLE DOCUMENTATION FOR VEO3 VIDEO GENERATOR:
 *
 * This comprehensive test suite demonstrates London School TDD applied to
 * complex video generation pipeline orchestration:
 *
 * 1. PIPELINE ORCHESTRATION TESTING:
 *    - Tests focus on HOW Veo3VideoGenerator coordinates rendering pipeline stages
 *    - Worker pool management, AI integration, quality control coordination
 *    - Storage management, performance monitoring, and error recovery
 *
 * 2. CONTRACT-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT:
 *    - All external dependencies mocked to verify interaction contracts
 *    - Service response contracts validated across all operations
 *    - Event emitter contracts ensure proper monitoring and coordination
 *
 * 3. COMPLEX WORKFLOW TESTING:
 *    - Multi-stage video generation pipeline with checkpointing
 *    - Dynamic worker allocation based on project complexity
 *    - AI-enhanced content generation with fallback strategies
 *    - Real-time performance monitoring and adaptive quality control
 *
 * 4. LONDON SCHOOL PRINCIPLES APPLIED:
 *    - RED: Define expected coordination behavior through failing tests
 *    - GREEN: Implement minimal orchestration logic to satisfy contracts
 *    - REFACTOR: Improve coordination patterns while maintaining test contracts
 *
 * Key Collaboration Patterns Tested:
 * - WorkerPool ↔ PipelineManager (resource allocation and task distribution)
 * - AIEngine ↔ VideoGenerator (content analysis and optimization)
 * - QualityController ↔ PerformanceMonitor (quality assessment and adaptation)
 * - StorageManager ↔ CheckpointSystem (data persistence and recovery)
 * - EventSystem ↔ MonitoringServices (real-time coordination and alerts)
 *
 * This design promotes high cohesion within the video generation pipeline
 * while maintaining loose coupling between subsystems through well-defined contracts.
