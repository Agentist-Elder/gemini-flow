/**
 * RED-GREEN-REFACTOR CYCLE DOCUMENTATION FOR IMAGEN4 GENERATOR:
 *
 * This comprehensive test suite demonstrates London School TDD with performance focus:
 *
 * 1. PERFORMANCE-FIRST TESTING:
 *    - All operations tested against strict performance targets
 *    - GPU memory optimization and utilization tracking
 *    - Batch processing efficiency and throughput optimization
 *    - Caching strategies for improved response times
 *
 * 2. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT VALIDATION:
 *    - Memory allocation and cleanup coordination
 *    - GPU utilization optimization under various load conditions
 *    - Storage management with automated cleanup strategies
 *    - Performance degradation handling with adaptive quality
 *
 * 3. QUALITY-PERFORMANCE BALANCE:
 *    - Quality assessment integrated without performance impact
 *    - Automatic enhancement with performance constraints
 *    - Performance-based quality adaptation mechanisms
 *    - SLA compliance validation across diverse scenarios
 *
 * 4. LONDON SCHOOL PRINCIPLES WITH PERFORMANCE FOCUS:
 *    - RED: Define performance requirements through failing tests
 *    - GREEN: Implement coordination logic to meet performance targets
 *    - REFACTOR: Optimize performance while maintaining functional contracts
 *
 * Key Performance Collaboration Patterns Tested:
 * - GPUAccelerator ↔ MemoryManager (efficient memory allocation and pooling)
 * - BatchProcessor ↔ PerformanceMonitor (optimal batch sizing and throughput)
 * - CacheManager ↔ AIEngine (intelligent caching for repeated requests)
 * - QualityAssessor ↔ PerformanceOptimizer (quality assessment with minimal overhead)
 * - ResourceMonitor ↔ AdaptiveQuality (dynamic quality adjustment under load)
 *
 * This design ensures high-performance image generation while maintaining
 * quality standards and resource efficiency across various operating conditions.
