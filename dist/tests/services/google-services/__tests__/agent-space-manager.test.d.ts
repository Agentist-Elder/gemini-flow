/**
 * RED-GREEN-REFACTOR CYCLE DOCUMENTATION FOR AGENT SPACE MANAGER:
 *
 * This test suite demonstrates London School TDD principles applied to
 * complex system orchestration:
 *
 * 1. MOCK-DRIVEN DESIGN:
 *    - All external dependencies are mocked to focus on interactions
 *    - Each test verifies HOW components collaborate, not their internal state
 *    - Mocks define contracts between AgentSpaceManager and its collaborators
 *
 * 2. BEHAVIOR VERIFICATION:
 *    - Tests verify that the right methods are called with the right parameters
 *    - Focus on orchestration patterns and coordination logic
 *    - Error handling tests verify proper cleanup and recovery coordination
 *
 * 3. CONTRACT TESTING:
 *    - Service response contracts are validated for consistency
 *    - Event emitter contracts ensure proper monitoring capabilities
 *    - Performance contracts verify non-functional requirements
 *
 * 4. RED-GREEN-REFACTOR CYCLES:
 *    - RED: Write test describing expected orchestration behavior
 *    - GREEN: Implement minimal coordination logic to pass the test
 *    - REFACTOR: Improve orchestration patterns while maintaining contracts
 *
 * The AgentSpaceManager acts as an orchestrator, coordinating between:
 * - IsolationEngine (environment management)
 * - ResourceOrchestrator (resource allocation)
 * - SecurityManager (access control and policies)
 * - NetworkManager (networking and traffic)
 * - StorageManager (persistent storage and backups)
 *
 * This design promotes loose coupling and high testability.
